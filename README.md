This repositoty contains all the source code, experiments and visual aid regarding the paper `tsMIST: Model Sensitivity Analysis with Time
Series Morphing`. 

`tsMIST` is a novel framework for evaluating robustness in time series classifiers. By introducing robustness metrics based on semantically meaningful perturbations in input data, in other words, smooth interpolations between time series from different classes. This allows for quantifying both the stability and consistency of decision boundaries. 


## Getting Started

```python
from source.models import Models
from source.morph2 import Morph
import numpy as np
from aeon.datasets import load_classification
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# load the data
X, y = load_classification('ECG200')
le = LabelEncoder()
y = le.fit_transform(y)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# train model 
model = Models('lstm', X_train, y_train) # 'lstm', 'catch22', 'rocket'
model.train_lstm()

# compute morphing 
morphing = Morph(X_test, y_test, np.unique(y)[0])
morphing.get_DTWGlobalBorderline(X_test.shape[0])
results = morphing.CalculateMorph([model])

# print results
for model in results.keys():
    data = results[model]['metrics']
    print(f"Model: {model}")
    print(f"tsMIST_Avg: {data['mean']}")
    print(f"tsMIST_Std: {data['std']}")

```
